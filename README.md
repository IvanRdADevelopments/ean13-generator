# EAN-13 Barcode Generator

This project is an EAN-13 barcode generator that allows you to input an alphanumeric reference, convert it into a unique numeric format, and generate a PNG file with the corresponding barcode.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Python virtual environment (optional, but recommended)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  Pillow==9.3.0
  python-barcode==0.13.1
🚀 Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/IvanRdADevelopments/ean13-generator.git
cd ean13-generator
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
To isolate the project's dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copiar código
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copiar código
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies
Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the program
Once the virtual environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the program using:

bash
Copiar código
python main.py
📝 Usage
When you run the program, a window will appear where you can:

Enter an alphanumeric reference.
Click the "Generate Barcode" button.
The program will convert the reference into an EAN-13 barcode and save it as a PNG file in the codigos_barras directory.
If the barcode has already been generated, the program will show a warning.

⚠️ Important Notes
No need to modify the source code to generate the barcode. The program is ready to use and will automatically generate the PNG file.
The .venv folder is not included in the repository. You will need to create your own virtual environment and ensure that the dependencies are installed.
🐞 Debugging
If you encounter any errors or issues during execution:

Ensure that the dependencies are correctly installed with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Verify that the virtual environment is active.
If the problem persists, check the log file generated by the init.bat script if you use the auto-launch option with init.vbs.
